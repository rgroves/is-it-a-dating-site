    <h1>About Is It A Dating App?</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the padded cell of modern romance, where every notification is
      a jump scare and even your smart fridge is secretly plotting to slide into
      your DMs. “Is It A Dating App?” exists because somewhere between the dawn
      of social media and the end of civilization (scheduled for next Tuesday),
      people decided that if an app lets you upload a profile pic, it must also
      be fair game for midnight booty-calls. We’re here to shine a flickering
      flashlight on those dark corners of the internet—and laugh maniacally when
      a colleague uses the company messaging app in an attempt to cuddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, we catalog mentions of incidents we find in the wild of the internet:
      ride-shares, note-taking tools, calorie trackers—any platform where
      over-caffeinated, thristy, fools mistake a comment field for a love
      letter. Our methodology? Equal parts snark, salt, and proprietary secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let’s be brutally honest: we’re not about saving the world, we’re
      rubber-necking the slow-motion car crash of digital courtship. Consider
      this site the gallows humor you need while society insists on flirting
      through your podcast’s comments secton. If our petty cynicism stops even
      one “🍩👈❔” message from haunting a user, we’ll declare victory—and
      promptly go back to doom-scrolling.
    </p>
    <p>
      So pull up a chair, pour yourself a drink, and take a quick scroll through
      our run down. It’s dark, it’s funny, it’s probably bad for your faith in
      humanity—but hey, at least we’re honest about it.
