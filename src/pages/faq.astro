    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <p>Here are some common questions and answers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>What is the purpose of this site?</strong>
        <p>
          Half sketch comedy premise, half public-service announcement, “Is It A
          Dating App?” keeps a living scoreboard of apps—tagging which ones are
          for wooing and which ones are for, say, ordering your late-night
          tacos—so horned-up hobgoblins stop hitting on everything with a login
          screen. We can’t shame the internet into at least pretending to behave
          itself, but we can pretend that we can and have a chuckle while doing
          it.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Hold up—how do you actually decide if an app is for dating or, you
          know, literally anything else?
        </strong>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, we can’t reveal our proprietary methods. For instance,
          we could never say that we corner the VC who funded it; if they brag
          about “monetizing loneliness” while refusing to mention an actual
          business model, we stamp it with a “Yes” and call it a day.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          I met my _____ on _____—does that mean it is a dating app now?
        </strong>
        <p>
          Congrats on meeting your soulmate through Digg. That’s no more a
          dating app than brushing your teeth with a pineapple is a dental
          hygiene plan—sure, it’s possible; it’s also painful and deeply
          unnecessary. Remember, just because you *technically can*, doesn’t
          mean you *should*.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Do you ever update your lists, or are you stuck in a time when MySpace
          top-eights were still breaking hearts?
        </strong>
        <p>
          Think of updates as celestial events: rare, mildly impressive, and
          greatly accelerated if enough people heckle us on social media.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Does sliding into DMs on a productivity tool count as “synergy” or
          harassment (asking for a coworker)?
        </strong>
        <p>
          Attaching a slide deck? Synergy. Attaching your bathroom selfie and
          asking “thoughts?” Harassment (and probably a write-up).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          How can I tactfully tell someone, “Hey, buddy, this is a tax-filing
          app, not FarmersOnly”?
        </strong>
        <p>
          If we’d cracked the code for politely deflecting thirst in electronic
          form, we’d already be sipping Series-C champagne at our unicorn
          startup “GentleNo™.” Until then, your best bet is a curt “Different
          kind of filing, friend,” and a swift log-out.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re actually working on monetizing the polite shutdown, but our
          “Nope-as-a-Service” is still in stealth... Stay tuned!
        </p>

        <strong>
          Can an app graduate from “Definitely Not a Dating App” to “Okay, Fine,
          Maybe” status?
        </strong>
        <p>
          Yep—Facebook pulled it off once it slapped a big “Dating” tab on the
          menu. If your favorite app adds its own neon-pink lovey-dovey switch,
          feel free to flirt; until then, try to at least pretend that you’re a
          decent human being.
