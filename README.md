# Is It A Dating App?

Welcome to the official repository for Is It A Dating App——the website you never knew you needed. Our mission? To shed some light (and some laughs) on the do's and don'ts of digital romance, gently poking fun at those who think every app is a dating app. Ever wondered if that app you're using is for finding love or getting a ride or just for ordering a pizza? Spoiler alert: Uber is not Tinder, and DoorDash isn’t your new dating hotspot. Join us as we navigate the hilariously misguided attempts of the romantically adventurous (or clueless) in the digital world.

## About the Project

"Is It A Dating App?" is meant to be partly humorous yet mostly sincere. The aim is to create an evolving list of apps and websites, categorizing them based on their intended use for dating or other purposes. In doing so, the hope is to foster a more respectful digital environment.
